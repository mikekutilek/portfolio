		<p>Time lapse is a form of photography that has been close to my heart since I first picked up a camera. I found it to be the perfect median between photography and videography, satisfying both hobbies at once. All time lapse videos are taken shot by shot with my Sony A6000, edited with Adobe Lightroom and assembled into video using Adobe Premiere. </p>
