<h3 class="block-title">About Me</h3>
<p class="center"><i>The goal is not to live forever, but to create something that will</i><br><span> - Andy Warhol</span></p>
<p>
	The above quote is one of my favorites and should tell you a good deal about me. With each opportunity in life, I strive to create something lasting. 
	<br><br>
	For a living, I am a software developer with a keen interest in data science and analytics. For fun, I am a photographer, videographer, runner, piano novice, and baseball fan. I'm a nerd; I watch sports with my mind bent on statistics. I'm a geek; I catch every Marvel flick before it leaves the theater. I'm a novice musician and can always appreciate a good concert. My favorite vacations involve hiking, sightseeing, and adventure. I live in the wonderful city of Pittsburgh with my girlfriend and our dog, Toby. I like to refer to myself as a jack-of-all-trades, master of some.

	The reason I made this site is because pointing someone at a single profile or github page doesn't tell my full story. Each section of this site is dedicated to work I have done, whether personally or professionally, that I am proud of and passionate about. Whether you are an employer, co-worker, friend, family, or colleague, I hope this site offers you a look inside my life.
