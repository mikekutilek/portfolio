	<p>Since college, one of my emerging passions has been videography. It spawned from watching the short openings Hockey Night in Canada would air before each playoff game. Each opening was a montage of clips and highlight reels surrounding the participating teams set to some song track. I decided I wanted to start making my own "opening montages", so I started up a local spin-off called <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hnipittsburgh">Hockey Night in Pittsburgh</a> and began recording all the Penguins games to accumulate footage. <br><br>After a year or so of middling popularity, the viewership really took off during the Penguins' 2016 Stanley Cup run. The following year, I received an offer from local multimedia juggernaut <a target="_blank" href="http://www.benstonium.com/">Benstonium</a> to start a partnership and display my videos on their site and social media pages. Of course I was thrilled to receive this offer. The exposure I was able to get was phenomenal. Today, I still contribute my work to the Benstonium team each playoff year. You can find all of my work on the <a target="_blank" href="http://youtube.com/hnipittsburgh">HNIP YouTube channel</a>, or embedded on this very page.</p>
