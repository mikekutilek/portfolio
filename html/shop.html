		<p>You can purchase my work online from two locations. <br><br>1) <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/MikeKutilekPhoto/">Etsy!</a></b> -- I have listings for any print that I have stocked in inventory. These typically include 8x10 prints that can be matted or framed and 16x20 wall hangings, such as Canvas, Metal, or Wood Panels. All products from Etsy are handled and shipped by me myself and I and will arrive in about a week on average. <br><br> 2) <b><a target="_blank" href="https://mikekutilek.zenfolio.com/">Zenfolio!</a></b> -- This is where I store a much wider selection of prints; anything ranging from your base 8x10 to wall covering sizes as large as 24x36. Some of these products are of the highest professional quality, printed by a series of Zenfolio labs. As such, the price is a bit steeper than on the Etsy site. All products on here are handled and shipped by Zenfolio. <br><br> Whatever you are looking for, I am hopeful I can provide it. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or concerns about either shop. My contact info can be found on the <a class="open-videography" href="/contact">Contact</a> page.</p>
