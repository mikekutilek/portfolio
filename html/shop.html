		<p>1) <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/MikeKutilekPhoto/">Etsy!</a></b> -- This is where I list my most popular prints at the most affordable prices. These typically include 8x10 prints that can be matted or framed and 16x20 wall hangings in styles of Canvas, Metal, or Wood Panels. A majority of these prints I have stocked in inventory, which means they are likely to arrive within a week of the order processing. Plus, everything in store gets FREE SHIPPING to the US! The value here is tough to beat so head on over! </p>

		<p>2) <b><a target="_blank" href="https://mikekutilek.zenfolio.com/">Zenfolio!</a></b> -- This is where I bring out the big guns; if you are looking for a large, high quality metal print to hang on the wall, this is where you'll get it. Zenfolio handles the ordering and processing of these upscale designs, which is why it's separated from Etsy. The photo gallery includes every photo I've taken and professionally edited and offers 5 options of Aluminum Art, ranging from 16x20 to 24x36. There are also dozens more options that I hide for simplicity's sake, so if you don't see what you want, please send me a message and I'll be happy to arrange a custom order! </p>
